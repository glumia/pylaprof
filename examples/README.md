Not yet a real test suite, just a bunch of tools I use for testing and development.

Usually I launch slowserver.go (`go run slowserver.go`) and then `launcher.py`
too see if everything work as I expect.

I also compare results to those of `py-spy` (https://github.com/benfred/py-spy)
to see if they make sense.
